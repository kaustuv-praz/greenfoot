/* algorithm for ball1.class basicMode() method starts*/

step 1: start.
step 2: move the ball by 3 unit on the direction the ball is facing.
step 3: check if the ball get intersect with barrier?
    If true: move the ball by 1 unit on the direction the ball is facing.
    If false: Goto step 4.

step 4: check if the ball get intersect with baby1?
    If true: turn the ball by 180 degree.
             move the ball by 5 unit on the direction the ball faces.
    If false: Goto step 5.

step 5: check if the ball get intersect with baby2?
    If true: turn the ball by 180 degree.
             move the ball by 5 unit on the direction the ball faces.
    If false: Goto step 6.

step 6: set "current_mode" value to 1.

step 7: stop.
