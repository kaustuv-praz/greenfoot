/* algorithm for ball1.class advanceMode() method starts*/

step 1: start;
step 2: move the ball by the value of "speed" on the direction the ball is facing.
step 3: call createWall() method.
step 4: call createBabies() method.
step 5: call intersect() method.
step 6: call isWorldEnd() method.
step 7: call scoreSytem() method.
step 8: set "current_mode" value to 3.

step 9: check if "speed_counter" is perfectly divisible by 1000?
    If true: increment the "speed" by 1.
    If false: Goto step 10.

step 10: increase the "speed_counter" by 1.
