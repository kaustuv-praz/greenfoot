/* algorithm for ball1.class intersect() method starts*/

step 1: start.
step 2: set random value to "ang" that is less than 78.
step 3: if "ang" is even change it to negative number.
step 4: create Actor objects of baby1.class and baby2.class.
step 5: get the current rotation of ball and set it to integer variable "roto".
step 6: check if the  ball is facing toward the baby1 Actor front side?
            If true: check if the ball intersect baby1?
                        If true: rotate the ball by 180 degree + "ang".
                                 move ball by 5 unit on the direction it is facing.
                                 call ballSound() method.
                        If false: Goto step 7.
            If false : Goto step 7.

step 7: check if the ball is facing toward the baby2 Actor front side?
            If true: check if the ball intersect baby2?
                        If true: rotate the ball by 180 degree + "ang".
                                 move ball by 5 unit on the direction it is facing.
                                 call ballSound() method.
                        If false: Goto step 8.
            If false : Goto step 8.

step 8: stop.
