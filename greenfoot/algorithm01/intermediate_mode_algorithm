/* intermediate mode algorithm */

step 1: Start.
step 2: Declare variables baby1_score, baby2_Score.
step 3: Add 2 babies on each team/side making all total of 6 babies.
step 4: Set the below statement in loop until the game is paused.

    step 5: If ball touches the barrier, do nothing.
    step 6: If ball touches either babies, reflect the ball random direction.
    step 7: If ball touches wall, reflect the ball in random direction.
    step 8: Make the right side babies move vertically up and down automatically.
    step 9: If the ball touches right side wall, then increase the value of baby1_Score by 1.
              baby1_Score = baby1_Score + 1   OR  baby1_Score++
    step 10: If the ball touches left side wall, then increase the value of baby2_Score by 1.
              baby2_Score = baby2_Score + 1   OR  baby2_Score++
    step 11: Control the baby on left side with keys individually.
    step 12: If baby1_Score is greater than or equals to 5. Declare baby on left side is winner.
             Goto step 15.
    step 13: If baby2_Score is greater than or equals to 5. Declare baby on right side is winner.
             Goto step 15.
    step 14: If the game is paused, show the pause instruction.
  /* Loop statement ends here */

step 15: End
